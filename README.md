## Buff Blueprint

Our idea is a generative AI plugin that leverages an API for an AI model to streamline academic planning for CU Boulder students. The system will have comprehensive knowledge of all courses offered at CU, track the classes a student has taken and needs to take, and generate a personalized academic plan. This solution will provide students with a structured path to graduation, making course selection more efficient and aligned with their academic goals.

The Buff Blueprint will include various features to enhance academic decision-making. It will help students decide which classes to take based on their major and minors while incorporating Rate My Professor reviews to guide course selection. Additionally, the system will integrate with Google Maps API to optimize commuting routes to campus, ensuring students can efficiently plan their schedules. The AI will also make class recommendations based on studentsâ€™ interests, ensuring a balance between required courses and engaging electives.

To support personalized academic planning, the system will provide each user with a dashboard to track their progress and store user data securely in a dedicated database. The AI will assist in long-term academic scheduling, ensuring students remain on track for graduation while adapting to their evolving interests and needs. By centralizing academic planning into one intelligent system, Buff Blueprint aims to reduce stress and improve decision-making for CU Boulder students.
