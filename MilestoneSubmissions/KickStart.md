## Buff Blueprint

Our idea is a generative AI plugin that leverages an API for an AI model to streamline academic planning for CU Boulder students. The system will have comprehensive knowledge of all courses offered at CU, track the classes a student has taken and needs to take, and generate a personalized academic plan. This solution will provide students with a structured path to graduation, making course selection more efficient and aligned with their academic goals.

Functionally, our webpage will have you login with your major and minors you are pursuing.  Using a chat gpt api, this will find the required classes you need to take to finish your majors and minors along with how many elective hours and technical elective hours you need. Upon registration you will tell the website what classes in your degree plan you have taken and it will show how much of your degree plan you have finished. This website will have additional functionalities that allow you to find possible elective courses based on your interests and skills, find rate my professor ratings for instructors of courses you are considering taking, and it will have a google maps plug-in that will show you a routing to get to your different classes based on another starting location on campus. 

The AI will assist in long-term academic scheduling, ensuring students remain on track for graduation while adapting to their evolving interests and needs. By centralizing academic planning into one intelligent system, Buff Blueprint aims to reduce stress and improve decision-making for CU Boulder students.

## Target Audience
The ideal users of Buff Blueprint are CU Boulder students who need a streamlined and intelligent way to plan their academic journey. These students may be undergraduates or graduate students looking for assistance in selecting courses, optimizing their schedules, and efficiently planning their path to graduation. They might struggle with course selection, balancing major and minor requirements, and navigating available resources for making informed academic decisions.

## Vision Statement
For CU Boulder students, who struggle with academic planning, course selection, and optimizing their schedules, the Buff Blueprint is an AI-powered academic planning tool that automates course selection, builds personalized academic plans, and integrates navigation and professor ratings to enhance decision-making. Unlike manual degree planning and generic advising tools, our product leverages AI to provide tailored recommendations, streamline scheduling, and improve the overall academic experience through an intuitive and accessible platform.
